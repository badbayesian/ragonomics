(Appendix: Survey Form for Starbucks Customers, page 1 of 2) [cite: page 35, 0-161].\n\n  - A broad bibliography/works cited section on nutrition labeling, calorie information, and consumer behavior related to food choices and obesity — spread across pages 36–38.

On average it does not affect Starbucks profits, and in some cases (stores near a competitor like Dunkin Donuts) it can even raise revenue. The authors identify learning and salience as the mechanisms behind the effect. They also argue that if calorie labeling were adopted more broadly, the resulting reduction in calories could translate into meaningful impacts on obesity, though the overall effect depends on how much of total calorie intake comes from chain restaurants and how widely labeling is implemented.",

In NYC Starbucks, calories per transaction fell about 6% on average, while the average price per item rose and Starbucks profits were not significantly affected, suggesting a shift toward higher-margin items.

This reflects measurement error in knowledge data. (2) Potential sampling/selection bias: cardholders may not be representative of Starbucks customers and could be less sensitive to calorie posting, biasing measured effects. (3) Time-series and margin issues: concerns about serial correlation and the need for conservative aggregation to isolate effects, which indicates measurement risk in attributing changes to posting.
