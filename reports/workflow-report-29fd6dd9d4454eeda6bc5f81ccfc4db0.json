        "question": "What problem or gap does it address compared to prior work?",

This helps address concerns that typically confound observational evaluations (tourism/composition). *(page 14 words 0–349; page 3 words 300–564)*\n\n- **Responds to prior work emphasizing information presentation but lacking this setting/data:**\n  - Prior literature highlights that consumers often do not seek/understand nutrition information and that *presentation/accessibility* matters; this paper examines a real-world mandatory posting regime with rich behavioral data rather than relying only on stated preferences or limited observations. *(page 7 words 300–566)*\n\n- **Explicit remaining gaps (what it does *not* solve):**\n  - Does **not** directly measure obesity/BMI effects due to data lags; only a “crude estimate” is possible.\n  - Only studies **one chain (Starbucks)**; cannot generalize to other chains or assess substitution/offsetting at home. *(page 3 words 300–564)*",

(Page 25, words 0–349)\n  - **Salience effect:** consumers may already “know” calories, but posting makes calories *top-of-mind at the point of purchase*, increasing their weight in decision-making. (Page 25, words 0–349)\n\n- **Novel method (data + identification approach):** Use unusually rich, real-world transaction and survey evidence to gauge policy impacts on *actual purchase behavior* and knowledge:\n  - **Universe of transactions** at Starbucks company stores in **NYC** spanning **Jan 1, 2008–Feb 28, 2009**, with **mandatory posting starting Apr 1, 2008**, plus **control-city transactions (Boston, Philadelphia)** without posting to control for other factors.

Central cited papers are: (1) Jacoby, Chestnut, and Silberman (1977), which is important because it provides early evidence that consumers often do not seek out or understand nutrition information, motivating why the presentation and salience of information (like menu calorie posting) matters; (2) Ippolito and Mathios (1990, 1995), Mathios (2000), and Kiesel and Villas-Boas (2008), which are central because they use actual sales data and find demand is sensitive to nutrition information, supporting the idea that disclosure can change purchasing behavior; (3) Variyam and Cawley (2006), which is central because it links nutrition labeling to reduced obesity (a downstream health outcome); (4) Anderson and Matsa (2011) and Currie et al. (2010), which are central because they directly test whether fast food restaurants affect obesity, framing the policy relevance of calorie posting at chain/fast food restaurants; and (5) Bassett et al. (2008), which is central because it is a pre-posting NYC chain-patron survey showing much higher “seeing calorie info” at Subway (which posted) versus other chains and fewer calories purchased among those who saw the info—directly motivating and contextualizing the study of mandatory restaurant calorie posting.",

The authors also report that using absolute calories (instead of logs) produces almost identical results. Additionally, to address serial correlation, they use a conservative pre/post aggregation test and still find approximately the same effect, significant at >99% confidence.",
